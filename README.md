# FaviconHash
FaviconHash is a Python script that leverages the mmh3 library to calculate the hash value of a favicon image. The script can be used to identify unique hash values associated with phishing websites. By searching for these hash values on Shodan using the "http.favicon.hash:&lt;hash>" query, potential websites can be discovered.
