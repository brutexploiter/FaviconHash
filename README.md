FaviconHash is a Python script that leverages the mmh3 library to calculate the hash value of a favicon image. The script can be used to identify unique hash values associated with websites. By searching for these hash values on Shodan using the "http.favicon.hash:<hash>" query, websites can be discovered.

### What is MurMurHash?
MurmurHash is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup. The name comes from two basic operations, multiply (MU) and rotate (R), used in its inner loop. The current version is MurmurHash3 which yields a 32-bit or 128-bit hash value. When using 128-bits, the x86 and x64 versions do not produce the same values, as the algorithms are optimized for their respective platforms. MurmurHash3 was released alongside SMHasherâ€”a hash function test suite.

```
# Usage
To use the FaviconHash tool, follow these steps:

```
favicon.py -u <URL> -a <SHODAN_API_KEY>
```
FaviconHash - Calculate and search favicon hash on Shodan.
```
Commands:
-u, --url: URL of the favicon
-a, --api-key: Specify Shodan API key

Options:
-h, --help: Show this help message and exit
-r, --random-agent: Use a random user agent
-c, --custom-agent: Specify a custom user agent
```

Example:

```
python favicon.py -u https://example.com/favicon.ico -a YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY -r
```
Please note that the "user-agents.txt" file is required in the same directory as the script to generate random user agents. Make sure to update the "user-agents.txt" file with a list of valid user agents.
